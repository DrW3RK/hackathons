Proof of geolocation over time has many use-cases, but it must have acceptable privacy; by leveraging internet security and Google's data, we can extract data privately and prove its origin publicly. Alibi enables anyone with a Google account to prove their historical location without sharing more information than necessary, creating a proof that can be used in any context, bringing web2 into web3. Though what we have is a proof of concept, we want to produce meaningful facts about geolocation over time without leaking additional data: “I spent over 180 days in Berlin in 2021”, “I wasn’t at the scene of the crime”, “I have been to this restaurant over 20 times, where is my free kimchi” – and then make it portable enough for onchain verifiers. | https://github.com/orgs/w3s-alibi/repositories                                                                                                          | https://havetorunthisbadboylocally.sorryaboutthat                                                                                                       | https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sT8KSk_zZ-IuYjFFUmSgybwyKwERL2IJcDuE1_ZZvTs/edit?usp=sharing                                                          | nan                                                                                   | I just want the judges to all know that they look lovely today, that they are funny and witty at parties, and above all that I would never stoop to currying favours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                 2   | Rust, TypeScript, React.                                                                                                                                     |

| DePHY Access                                          | Darren Seah                    | DePHY Access is a decentralized application (dApp) designed to facilitate user access to decentralized resources in the DePIN sector. These resources are defined as discrete, asymmetric off-chain nodes that accept connections from end-users via the internet. Unlike traditional blockchain nodes, these asymmetric off-chain nodes operate independently and may not share the same state. The project aims to address various use cases, including renting GPU resources, accessing decentralized computing cloud workers, and querying sensitive data from sensor equipment. By providing a secure and efficient mechanism for accessing off-chain nodes, DePHY Access seeks to expand the boundaries of Web3 technology and promote decentralization across various sectors.                                            | https://github.com/jasl/blockspace-hackathon-2024                                                                                                       | https://drive.google.com/file/d/175yXF5hHe_JqPTLDFhH_kXX3AKnSCs1t/view?usp=sharing                                                                      | nan                                                                                                                                                           | nan                                                                                   | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 3   | Ollama, EVM Pallet, dephy messaging layer, DePHY ID, Solidity?                                                                                               |

Instead of manually tracking accounts accross different Polkadot parachains and on different indexers, Dot Takeout is a purpose built tool that provides you all the data for your accounts in one place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://github.com/KarimJedda/takeout/                                                                                                                  | https://dottakeout.xyz                                                                                                                                  | https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1--9A0csRwvrof6-jZSfTFK3GjT1nsqCCW11r-E-eSUI/edit#slide=id.g2206d6f2d92_0_13                                           | https://x.com/KarimJDDA/status/1825997453415309438                                    | Demo not working 100% online, locally it's fine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                 2   | Python, Flask, React                                                                                                                                         |

| PAPI Actions                                          | Josep Maria Sobrepere Profitos | This defines a series of intents, a routing system that uniquely identifies one action to be performed, which can be implemented by dApps or extensions.  The idea is that anyone can "Create an action", which is serialised into a route, and then this route can be shared to other peers. A dApp implementation that supports that intent can then perform the action based on the user's state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | https://github.com/polkadot-api/web3-blockspace-actions/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file                                                                    | https://web3-blockspace-actions.vercel.app/                                                                                                             | nan                                                                                                                                                           | nan                                                                                   | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 4   | Polkadot API, React, RxJS                                                                                                                                    |

Users can speculate on player market values while football clubs hedge their transfer risks. We create player derivatives through an over-collateralized system that rewards liquidity providers, addressing the gap left by the last football player exchange, which shut down due to mismanagement. As a proof of concept, we've developed an algorithmic, over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to FC Barcelona's market value. Our next crucial step is to establish a reliable data feed to support our protocol.                                                                                                                                                        | https://github.com/phipsae/peggd                                                                                                                        | https://peggd.vercel.app/                                                                                                                               | https://www.canva.com/design/DAGOakrdDGE/WqRK5eQOyST3e8lMaANtcQ/view?utm_content=DAGOakrdDGE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor       | nan                                                                                   | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                 2   | Backend Solidity, Front end Wagmi & VIEM                                                                                                                     |

It allows developers to create proposals for issues they find interesting, set a price, and share the link to gather funding from the community. Once the funding goal is met, the funds are released to the developer after a waiting period, ensuring community approval. Propcorn is simple on purpose, focusing only on micro-funding for small development tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | https://github.com/deeecent/propcorn/                                                                                                                   | https://propcorn.deeecent.website/                                                                                                                      | nan                                                                                                                                                           | https://x.com/vrde/status/1826210786567418327                                         | There are many funding platforms out there: gitcoin.co, onlydust.com, octant.app, clr.fund.

These smart contracts trigger the release of rewards once survey conditions are met, without the need for manual intervention. Businesses can fund surveys using tokens or NFTs, offering flexibility and innovative, tangible rewards that can appreciate in value. Further innovating in data privacy and security, QSTN utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs serve as immutable proof of participation, allowing users to claim rewards while maintaining complete privacy. The system verifies participation without accessing any private data. QSTN addresses the significant challenge of engaging users in surveys, which often leads to low response rates and poor data quality in traditional methods. By incorporating gamification elements such as leaderboards, points, and digital rewards, QSTN makes the survey experience more engaging and rewarding. Our innovative reward mechanisms, including NFTs and digital tokens, attract a wider audience and provide tangible benefits to users, fostering long-term engagement and loyalty. Furthermore, our AI-driven survey tools and credibility scoring systems ensure businesses receive high-quality, reliable data.

The Substrate Node is a forked version of the Substrate repo to allow "native execution". This is by no means a production ready implementation, and has a lot of warning. In the future the ideal Substrate / Polkadot implementation would re-write heavy parts of the SVM and or RBPF to make it WASM compatible (no_std). In essence this is a pallet that references the SVM entirely, but uses Substrate storage to manage accounts, since this is a hack approach we have a lot of Rust standard library depedencies. A lot of the work dealt with compatibility between libraries, particularly cryptographic. Discussion over this has been ongoing with the Solana Turbine community who was helpful these past 2 days discussing update the SVM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                 1   | Solana / SVM repository, Polkadot SDK / Substrate                                                                                                            |

The token becomes also a proof of participation in the installation and the finished drawing is then pushed automatically to every participants wallet as an NFT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | https://github.com/mischa-robots/drawbot-symmetry-hackathon                                                                                             | https://www.instagram.com/mischa.ai/                                                                                                                    | https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sJA1RIzh0gFkisng4Wsj6-m4809c6-8Ook7pBDd0VCk/edit?usp=sharing                                                          | nan                                                                                   | https://www.youtube.com/@mischa-ai                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                 2   | Jetson Nano, Rust, html, js, css, NMKR Api                                                                                                                   |
