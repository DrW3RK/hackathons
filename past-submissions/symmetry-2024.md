Webzero hosted a chain-agnostic hackathon alongside the main [web3summit event](web3summit.com). The hackathon kicked off at 10AM on Monday August 19th and submissions were due at 1PM on Wednesday August 21st. There was a total of 28 submissions. Well done to everyone who participated! 🚀

_A fully-functional and user-friendly, decentralized web can only be achieved when we find symmetry—without sacrificing our ideals._

_- How can we improve decentralized technology’s usability without compromising security?_

_- Can we unify fragmented innovations into a cohesive ecosystem?_

_- Can we go further in innovating the bedrock on which decentralized applications currently rest on?_

_The symmetry lies in a balance of opposites and tensions in ideals, a harmony between opposing forces. Take a chance to ignite your hacker spirit and find the balance (source: https://symmetry.theblockspace.net/)_.

| Airdrops for Everyone on Polkadot                     | Daniel Vaculík                 | Airdrops at the moment are very expensive. we aim to make them cheaper by utilising merkle trees/root and merkle proofs. It makes the airdrops multiple times cheaper.

| PAPI Actions                                          | Josep Maria Sobrepere Profitos | This defines a series of intents, a routing system that uniquely identifies one action to be performed, which can be implemented by dApps or extensions. The idea is that anyone can "Create an action", which is serialised into a route, and then this route can be shared to other peers. A dApp implementation that supports that intent can then perform the action based on the user's state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | https://github.com/polkadot-api/web3-blockspace-actions/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file                                                                    | https://web3-blockspace-actions.vercel.app/                                                                                                             | nan                                                                                                                                                           | nan                                                                                   | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                 4 | Polkadot API, React, RxJS                                                                                                                                    |

Users can speculate on player market values while football clubs hedge their transfer risks. We create player derivatives through an over-collateralized system that rewards liquidity providers, addressing the gap left by the last football player exchange, which shut down due to mismanagement. As a proof of concept, we've developed an algorithmic, over-collateralized stablecoin pegged to FC Barcelona's market value. Our next crucial step is to establish a reliable data feed to support our protocol. | https://github.com/phipsae/peggd                                                                                                                        | https://peggd.vercel.app/                                                                                                                               | https://www.canva.com/design/DAGOakrdDGE/WqRK5eQOyST3e8lMaANtcQ/view?utm_content=DAGOakrdDGE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor       | nan                                                                                   | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                 2 | Backend Solidity, Front end Wagmi & VIEM                                                                                                                     |

| Solana VM Substrate Runtime                           | Irvin Cardenas                 | Solana stands as one of the top 5 smart contract platforms in the blockchain ecosystem and top 5 in market cap.

The Substrate Node is a forked version of the Substrate repo to allow "native execution". This is by no means a production ready implementation, and has a lot of warning. In the future the ideal Substrate / Polkadot implementation would re-write heavy parts of the SVM and or RBPF to make it WASM compatible (no_std). In essence this is a pallet that references the SVM entirely, but uses Substrate storage to manage accounts, since this is a hack approach we have a lot of Rust standard library depedencies. A lot of the work dealt with compatibility between libraries, particularly cryptographic. Discussion over this has been ongoing with the Solana Turbine community who was helpful these past 2 days discussing update the SVM.                                                                                                                                         |                 1 | Solana / SVM repository, Polkadot SDK / Substrate                                                                                                            |
