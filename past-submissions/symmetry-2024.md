*A fully-functional and user-friendly, decentralized web can only be achieved when we find symmetryâ€”without sacrificing our ideals.*

*- How can we improve decentralized technologyâ€™s usability without compromising security?*

*- Can we unify fragmented innovations into a cohesive ecosystem?*

*- Can we go further in innovating the bedrock on which decentralized applications currently rest on?*

*The symmetry lies in a balance of opposites and tensions in ideals, a harmony between opposing forces. Take a chance to ignite your hacker spirit and find the balance (source: https://symmetry.theblockspace.net/)*.
