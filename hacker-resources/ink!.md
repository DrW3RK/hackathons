# Ideas to build

With ink! 5.0, there's a lot of things that can be done that will improve the application landscape in the Polkadot ecosystem. This is a list of some of these ideas:

* Bounty system and payouts automated by an ink! smart contract dApp
* Send funds to ink! contract to distribute funds deterministically 
* Multisigs with ink! and account abstraction
* DAO launch pad with treasuries and multisig functionality out of the box
* Management systems for treasury budget spending
