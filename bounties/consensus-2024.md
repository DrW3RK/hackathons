## Polkadot sponsored track — $37,000 in prizes

[Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) is a thriving ecosystem of interconnected, specialized app-chains powered by the “layer-0” Polkadot blockchain. Polkadot has its native DOT token used for securing the network ([Staking](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview)), participating in on-chain governance ([OpenGov](https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/)) and interacting with its [system chains](https://polkadot.network/features/system-parachains/). It also has its own asset hub with over $13.1M in USDC, trustless bridging capabilities and a mechanism that connects the 50+ app-chains ready to be integrated into the next web3 super dApp.

For this special hackathon edition, you’re free to build whatever comes to mind that you think can enhance Polkadot’s usability, leverage its core features, or launch your own applications powered by its technology. 

**Bonus**: you can also win additional prizes from the following participating ecosystem teams: 

* [Talisman](https://docs.talisman.xyz/): an Ethereum and Polkadot compatible wallet solution
* [Phala](https://docs.phala.network/): paving the way in bringing AI agents fully on-chain
* [Unique Network](https://docs.unique.network/): an EVM compatible app-chain providing APIs to integrate the most advanced NFT technologies on Polkadot 
* [Acurast](https://docs.acurast.com/): an API for integrating a mobile-first decentralized cloud
* [Robonomics](https://wiki.robonomics.network/): a futuristic IoT platform providing APIs for smart home and robotics use cases  

But wait ... there’s one more thing. Polkadot is offering a Web3 Community Prize of **$1k to any team that integrates some element of Polkadot to their submissions to other sponsored tracks.**

## Overview of prizes

For submissions to the general Polkadot track:

* 1st place ($11k)
* 2nd place ( $8k)
* 3rd place ($5k)
* Web3 community Prize: $1k (*)

(*) to any submissions to other sponsored tracks that integrate Polkadot in some way.

## Additional ecosystem bounties

Combine your submission with any of these ecosystem bounties:

* Build an AI agent with [Phala](https://docs.phala.network/) and OpenAI ($2k)
* Implement advanced Unique NFTs in a web3 game app with [Unique Network](https://docs.unique.network/) ($4k)
* Build a dApp that leverages both EVM and Substrate accounts using [Talisman](https://docs.talisman.xyz/), making sure authentication UX is great ($2k)
* Build a practical web3 use case for a cyber-physical system with [Robonomics](https://wiki.robonomics.network/) ($2k)
* Innovate with [StellaSwap](https://docs.stellaswap.com/) for the best DeFi solution ($2k)
* Build an application leveraging [Acurast’s](https://docs.acurast.com/) compute (Google Pixel 8a + 2500 cACU)

## Submission requirements

We’re looking for submissions that hit the nail on the head on any of the following things:

✅ Benefit the Polkadot community 

✅ Use the native DOT token

✅ Leverage Polkadot’s existing on-chain features like governance, staking, identity management, cross-chain bridging or native messaging with XCM

✅ Use Polkadot’s core technologies like Substrate, ink or XCM

All submissions to ecosystem bounties must adhere to the requirements specified by their respective teams.

## Your task

Pick what you want to build, pitch your best idea and demo a proof-of-concept on demo day.

## Judging 

You’ll be judged on:

* Go-to-market strategy 
* Tech design, creativity and ideation
* User experience

For specific ecosystem bounties, refer to their specific judging criterias.

## Ideas

**Not sure what to build? We’ve put together some ideas for you to take inspiration from!**

The Polkadot blockchain already has a lot of functionality you can integrate to a front-end application that could be game changing for end-users. Think of user facing solutions that interest you! Things like:

* A mobile app to help users stay updated about topics in OpenGov
* A crypto-cash app that allows payments in USDC from the Polkadot Asset Hub  
* An event management app that can pay participants in any asset via the Asset Hub
* A React component for a Polkadot bridging fee estimator
* A slick front-end app for creating DAOs funded by the Polkadot treasury

Perhaps you’re more interested in building developer libraries or integrations to extend what Polkadot already has. Some ideas:

* Tools for developing and integrating appchains
* Creating a React component library for easily building light client web applications
* An ink! dApp deployment leveraging cross-chain runtime interactions
* Cross-ecosystem core integrations (e.g. SUI on DOT, Talisman integration to Rootstock)
* App-chain ideas to deploy on Polkadot
