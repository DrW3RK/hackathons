# Polkadot resources

A curated collection of resources for builders working on Polkadot bounties.

## Appchain development

* Set up your development environment: https://docs.substrate.io/install/   
* Template nodes: https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/templates/
- [Frontier](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/): a tool suite that provides an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate based chains
- [XCM docs](https://paritytech.github.io/xcm-docs/): XCM is a language for communicating intentions between consensus systems

## UI and app development

- [Polkadot JS API](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/): the Javascript library for interacting with Substrate blockchains
- [Polkadot UI](https://github.com/polkadot-ui): helpful components for building Polkadot UIs, hooks, recipes, network information in a puzzle-fit manner (see [Polkadot Cloud](https://polkadot.cloud/) documentation)
- [Substrate Connect](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-connect): Run Wasm Light Clients of any Substrate based chain directly in your browser
- [Subxt](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/): a library for interacting with Substrate based nodes in pure Rust
- [Subxt Yew UI integration](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/tree/master/examples/wasm-example): an example of building a UI entirely in Rust 

## Tools
- [Zombienet](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/): a testing framework for Substrate based blockchains, providing a simple CLI tool that allows users to spawn and test ephemeral networks
- [Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar): REST service that makes it easy to interact with blockchain nodes built using Substrate
